# Townlight Records — Change Control Register

**Canonical Spec:** `docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md` (Unified Design Specification v2.0, April 12, 2026)

Every intentional deviation from the canonical spec is recorded here with rationale and approval status. This document is the audit trail for scope decisions. If a feature is in the canonical spec but not in the code, it must either appear in the reconciliation backlog or have an entry here explaining why.

---

## Format

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ID** | Sequential identifier (CC-001, CC-002, etc.) |
| **Date** | Date the decision was made |
| **Canonical Spec Says** | What the spec requires (section reference) |
| **Actual Decision** | What the team is doing instead |
| **Rationale** | Why the deviation is justified |
| **Approved By** | Who authorized this deviation |
| **Status** | Approved / Pending / Rejected |

---

## Change Register

*No approved changes yet. This register was established on 2026-04-13 as part of a process correction after the development team was found to be working from a superseded spec document. All deviations from the canonical spec identified during the reconciliation (Step 3) will be logged here for formal review and approval.*

## Pending Decisions (to be resolved during reconciliation)

These items were identified as potential intentional deviations but have NOT been approved. They are listed here so they can be formally reviewed:

| ID | Date | Canonical Spec Says | Proposed Deviation | Rationale (draft) | Status |
|----|------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------|
| CC-001 | 2026-04-13 | Tier 2 NER/NLP redaction via Ollama or spaCy [v1.1] (Section 12.7) | Defer beyond v1.1 | Deploying NER-based automated redaction detection may push the system from "staff productivity tool" to "automated decision-making" under Colorado CAIA (SB 24-205), risking high-risk classification. Needs legal review. | **Pending** |
| CC-002 | 2026-04-13 | Tier 3 Visual AI — faces/plates in video, OCR for scanned docs, speech-to-text [v2.0] (Section 12.7) | Keep as v2.0, no change proposed | Listed here for tracking. No deviation — canonical spec already places this at v2.0. | **No action needed** |
| CC-003 | 2026-04-13 | RPA bridge as last-resort connector [v2.0] (Section 12.4) | Keep as v2.0, no change proposed | Listed here for tracking. No deviation — canonical spec already places this at v2.0. | **No action needed** |
| CC-004 | 2026-04-13 | Active Discovery Engine with network scanning [v1.1] (Section 12.3) | Defer to v1.2+ | No backend implementation exists. Nav item and route removed from v1.1. Discovery.tsx preserved as UI starting point. Significant security implications for municipal networks — defer until IT security review is complete. Approved 2026-04-14. | **Approved** |
| CC-005 | 2026-04-13 | Version numbering: canonical spec uses phase-based naming (Phase 0-4), repo used semver (v1.0.0, v1.0.1, v1.1.0) | Semver tracks release history; canonical spec phases track design completeness. They are separate systems and do not need to align. v1.1.0 is the current release baseline. Phase 1 UX completion tracked as work items within v1.2.0 milestone rather than as a prerequisite claimed as done. | The canonical spec's phases are design phases, not release milestones. Walking back version numbers on a public repo with 158 commits and a CHANGELOG would create confusion and signal false regression. The reconciliation document bridges the two systems — semver says what shipped, phases say what's design-complete. Approved by project owner 2026-04-13. | **Approved** |

## Process

1. Any intentional deviation from the canonical spec requires an entry in this register.
2. Entries start as **Pending** until reviewed and approved by the project owner.
3. "Not in the spec" is never an acceptable justification for removing a feature. If a feature is being deferred or cut, the rationale must reference a concrete concern (regulatory, technical, resource, or user research).
4. Approved entries become the authoritative record for that decision. The canonical spec is NOT modified — this register documents where and why the implementation diverges.
5. During code reviews, reviewers should check that any spec deviation has a corresponding entry here.
