# Townlight Records -- Canonical Spec Gap List

**Generated:** 2026-04-13
**Source:** `docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md` v2.0 (April 12, 2026)
**Method:** Spec section-by-section comparison against codebase at HEAD

## How to Read This Document

Each item lists:
- **Spec reference** (section number, phase tag)
- **Code status** (exists / partial / missing)
- **What's missing** (specific deliverable gap)

Items completed during the current session are noted but NOT re-listed unless they have remaining sub-gaps.

## Phase 0: Design Foundation [MVP-NOW] -- COMPLETE

Spec Section 11 marks Phase 0 as COMPLETE. Verified in codebase:
- shadcn/ui installed (`frontend/src/components/ui/`)
- Design tokens mapped to CSS variables (`globals.css`)
- Sidebar layout shell (`app-shell.tsx`, `sidebar-nav.tsx`)
- Component variants: buttons, badges, cards, tables, stat-cards, empty-states
- Typography scale implementation

**No gaps in Phase 0.**

## Summary Counts

| Phase | Total Items | Complete | Partial | Not Started |
|-------|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Phase 0 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Phase 1 (UI pages) | 11 pages | 0 verified | 11 need verification | 0 (all pages exist as files) |
| Phase 2 (Backend) | ~20 items | 12 | 5 | 3 |
| Phase 3 (v1.1) | 18 | 0 | 0 | 18 |
| Phase 4 (v2.0) | 13 | 0 | 0 | 13 |
| WCAG | 9 requirements | 1 | 2 | 6 |

### Critical Path for v1.0 Release

The following Phase 2 items are **blocking** and must be completed before the staff workbench is functional end-to-end:

1. **Context Manager** (Section 4) -- all LLM features depend on this
2. **Response letter generation** (Section 8.3) -- core workflow feature
3. **Onboarding service LLM logic** (Section 12.2) -- first-run experience
4. **Tier 1 regex verification/expansion** (Section 12.7.1) -- compliance requirement
5. **Fee tracking API router** (Section 5) -- needed for request detail page
6. **Skip-to-content link** (Section 9) -- WCAG 2.2 AA hard requirement

Phase 1 pages all exist as files but need **visual verification** against the spec wireframes to confirm they match the redesign requirements. This verification should be done with a running frontend.
