"""Onboarding LLM-guided adaptive interview endpoint.

The interview endpoint walks a shared list of CityProfile fields in priority
order. On each POST, if the caller supplies the previous answer, this
endpoint persists that answer onto the singleton CityProfile row
(creating the row on the first answer if none exists) and then generates
the next question for the first remaining empty field.

T5A (2026-04-22): this endpoint was previously pure-generation; the
frontend was expected to call PATCH /city-profile on its own to persist.
That split produced three failure modes:

1. No profile exists yet: frontend PATCH returns 404 and the UI silently
   swallows the error. Answer is lost.
2. ``has_dedicated_it`` was in the CityProfile model but never asked by
   the interview because it was missing from the tracked field walk.
3. ``onboarding_status`` was never transitioned by the interview path;
   rows created via interview stayed ``not_started`` forever.

The shared ``civiccore.onboarding`` helpers now own the field order,
normalization, completion-state calculation, and skip-aware next-question
selection so this router does not drift from the rest of the suite.
