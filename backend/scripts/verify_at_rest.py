"""T6 / ENG-001 — operator verification script for at-rest encryption.

Checks that every row in ``data_sources`` stores its ``connection_config``
as the v1 versioned envelope ``{"v": 1, "ct": "..."}``. A single plaintext
row is a Tier-6 compliance break.

Usage (from repo root):

    docker compose run --rm --no-deps api python scripts/verify_at_rest.py

Exit codes:

    0 — every row is encrypted.
    1 — at least one row is not encrypted (plaintext or unknown shape).
    2 — unexpected runtime error (DB unreachable, etc.).

This script is intended as a post-deploy sanity check. The Alembic
migration ``019_encrypt_connection_config`` runs automatically on
startup; running this afterward is belt-and-suspenders verification that
all rows actually landed in the encrypted shape.

Does NOT decrypt any row. Only inspects the envelope shape. That means
it succeeds even if the operator's encryption key has since been
rotated or lost — it is purely a shape check, not a correctness check.
