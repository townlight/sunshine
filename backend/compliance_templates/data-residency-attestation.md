## Attestation of Local Data Residency for Townlight Records

I, {{CONTACT_NAME}}, {{CONTACT_TITLE}} of {{CITY_NAME}}, {{STATE}}, hereby attest to the following facts regarding the deployment and operation of Townlight Records within {{CITY_NAME}}'s infrastructure.

## 1. Attestation Statements

### 1.1 Local Deployment

Townlight Records is installed and operates exclusively on server hardware owned by {{CITY_NAME}} and physically located at:

**{{FACILITY_ADDRESS}}**

The system is administered by {{CITY_NAME}} IT staff. No third party has physical or remote administrative access to the server unless explicitly authorized by {{CONTACT_NAME}} for a documented maintenance purpose.

### 1.2 No Cloud Services

Townlight Records does not use, connect to, or depend on any cloud computing services, including but not limited to:

- Cloud-hosted databases or storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage)
- Cloud-hosted AI/ML inference APIs (e.g., OpenAI API, Azure AI, Google Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock)
- Cloud-hosted application platforms (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, Azure App Service)
- Cloud-hosted search or analytics services

All application components — the web server, database, AI models, document storage, and search indices — run on locally hosted infrastructure described in Section 3 below.

### 1.3 No Telemetry or External Data Transmission

Townlight Records does not transmit any data to external servers, services, or endpoints. Specifically:

- No usage analytics or telemetry data is collected or transmitted.
- No crash reports or error logs are sent to external services.
- No document content, metadata, or user information is transmitted outside {{CITY_NAME}}'s network.
- No DNS, NTP, or other protocol-level communications are made to vendor-operated servers beyond standard OS-level services controlled by {{CITY_NAME}} IT.
- The application does not phone home, check for updates externally, or communicate with any Townlight Records project infrastructure.

### 1.4 Local AI Models

All artificial intelligence and machine learning models used by Townlight Records operate locally:

- Model weights are stored on {{CITY_NAME}}'s servers.
- All inference (AI processing) occurs on {{CITY_NAME}}'s hardware.
- No data is sent to external APIs for AI processing.
- Models are not updated, fine-tuned, or retrained using external services.
- Model updates, if any, are performed manually by {{CITY_NAME}} IT staff through a controlled process.
