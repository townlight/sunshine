"""Tests for onboarding LLM-guided interview.

T5A (2026-04-22): the interview endpoint now persists answers in-endpoint
and transitions ``onboarding_status``. The tests below cover:
  - First-time onboarding with no existing CityProfile.
  - Partial-progress persistence across multiple interview round-trips.
  - ``has_dedicated_it`` end-to-end yes/no → bool persistence.
  - ``onboarding_status`` transitions: not_started → in_progress → complete.
