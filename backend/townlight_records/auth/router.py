# T5D — self-registration router. `register_router` is always constructed
# here, but whether it gets **mounted** on the live FastAPI app is decided
# dynamically in ``townlight_records.main.create_app()`` based on ``settings.portal_mode``.
# Keeping the gate at `create_app` time (instead of module-import time)
# lets per-test fixtures flip ``settings.portal_mode`` and get a cleanly
# regated app without reimporting modules. In ``PORTAL_MODE=private`` this
# router is not mounted, so ``POST /auth/register`` returns the
# FastAPI 404 — the endpoint effectively does not exist on the public wire
# (403 would advertise that registration is a gated feature; 404 does not).

# PATCH /users/me uses UserSelfUpdate so role and department_id cannot be
# self-modified. Admin role/department changes go through /admin/users/{id}.
