"""T5D public surface — authenticated records-request submission for residents.

This router is mounted under ``/public`` by :mod:`townlight_records.main` **only when**
``settings.portal_mode == "public"`` (see the import guard in ``main.py``).
In private-mode deployments the module is never imported, so every
``/public/*`` path returns 404.

Per Scott's 2026-04-22 Option A decision:

* **Authenticated submission only.** Residents self-register via
  ``POST /auth/register`` (also gated on public mode in :mod:`townlight_records.auth.router`),
  which creates a :class:`UserRole.PUBLIC` account. They sign in through
  the normal JWT flow and submit records requests as themselves. The
  ``created_by`` foreign key on :class:`RecordsRequest` is populated with
  the submitter's user id, preserving clean audit ownership.
* **No anonymous walk-up submission.** A non-nullable ``created_by`` on
  ``records_requests`` would require a schema migration to support
  anonymous submission; that was explicitly rejected as out of T5D scope
  on 2026-04-22.
* **PUBLIC-only.** Only users with ``UserRole.PUBLIC`` can call this
  endpoint. Staff-level roles submit through the existing
  ``/requests/`` staff workbench surface; routing them through the
  public endpoint would muddy the audit trail.
