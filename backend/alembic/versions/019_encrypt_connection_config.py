"""Encrypt data_sources.connection_config at rest (Tier 6 / ENG-001).

T2B closed the runtime-exposure side of connector credentials (redacted
from staff-role responses via `DataSourceRead`). ENG-001 remained open
for the at-rest side: plaintext JSON in the `connection_config` column
was still visible to any operator with DB access — `pg_dump` output,
restored snapshots, Postgres superuser sessions, SQL-level backups.

This migration closes that gap. The column stays JSONB in Postgres; the
cell contents become the versioned envelope
``{"v": 1, "ct": "<fernet-token>"}`` produced by
:mod:`townlight_records.security.at_rest`. Runtime code continues to see a plain dict
thanks to the ``EncryptedJSONB`` TypeDecorator on the SQLAlchemy column.

Properties:

* **Reversible.** ``upgrade()`` encrypts every plaintext row.
  ``downgrade()`` decrypts every envelope row back to plaintext.
* **Idempotent.** Both directions skip rows that already match the
  target shape. Re-running ``upgrade`` on an already-encrypted table is
  a no-op; same for ``downgrade`` on an already-decrypted one.
* **Key-required in both directions.** The operator must have
  ``ENCRYPTION_KEY`` set for EITHER direction. Downgrade
  with a missing/rotated key fails loudly rather than silently wiping
  data.

Operator rollout note (also documented in USER-MANUAL.md): set the
encryption key env var BEFORE restarting the app. The migration runs
on startup (see `townlight_records.main.lifespan`); a missing key causes the fail-fast
check in `Settings.check_encryption_key` to raise before any row is
touched.
