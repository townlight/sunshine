"""Phase 2 — backfill prompt_templates.consumer_app for records-ai overrides

Revision ID: 020_phase2_consumer_app_backfill
Revises: 019_encrypt_connection_config
Create Date: 2026-04-25

Context
-------
townlight_core's ``townlight_core_0002_llm`` migration ALTERs the shared
``prompt_templates`` table to:

* rename ``name`` → ``template_name``
* add ``consumer_app VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'townlight_core'``
* add ``is_override BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false``
* drop ``UNIQUE(name)`` and add ``UNIQUE(consumer_app, template_name, version)``

After that ALTER runs against an existing records-ai DB, every existing
``prompt_templates`` row inherits ``consumer_app='townlight_core'`` and
``is_override=false`` from the column defaults. But those rows were written
by records-ai (townlight_core v0.2.0 ships no DB-seed templates), and the
template resolver in :func:`townlight_core.llm.templates.resolve_template`
needs records-ai-owned rows to carry the records-ai consumer label so the
override registry resolves them in front of any townlight_core default. Without
this backfill, records-ai prompts would never be reached by the resolver.

The backfill is intentionally a single ``UPDATE`` with no WHERE pattern
beyond ``consumer_app = 'townlight_core'`` — townlight_core v0.2.0 ships zero
DB-seed prompt rows, so any row currently labelled ``'townlight_core'`` is
records-ai data. Idempotency: re-running this migration after the records
rows already carry ``'townlight_records'`` matches zero rows and is a no-op.
