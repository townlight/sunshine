# CivicSunshine

> Formerly published as "CivicRecords AI"; renamed 2026-07. Package and service identifiers are unchanged.

**Open-source, locally-hosted AI that helps American cities respond to open records requests.**

> **Release train notice (2026-05-24).** CivicSunshine v1.7.3 adds wheel and sdist release assets for direct-pip consumers. No functional behavior changes; the city-core installer continues to vendor source, and the runtime remains pinned to the published CivicCore v1.2.0 shared-ingestion release wheel. The older `v1.4.10` tag remains available as historical source only and must not be promoted as an attested baseline.

CivicSunshine runs entirely on a single machine inside your city's network — no cloud subscriptions, no vendor lock-in, no resident data leaving the building. It ingests your city's documents, makes them searchable with AI-powered natural language queries, detects potential exemptions, and manages the full request lifecycle from intake to response.

## Why This Exists

Every city in America processes open records requests (FOIA, CORA, and state equivalents). Staff manually search file shares, email archives, and databases — then review every document for exemptions before release. It's slow, error-prone, and a growing burden as request volumes increase.

No open-source tool exists for the **responder side** of open records at the municipal level. CivicSunshine fills that gap.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Search** — Natural language hybrid search (semantic + keyword) across all ingested city documents with source attribution, normalized relevance scores, and optional AI-generated summaries
- **Document Ingestion** — Automatic parsing of PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, email, HTML, and text files. Scanned documents processed via multimodal AI (Gemma 4) with Tesseract OCR fallback
- **Exemption Detection** — Tier 1 PII detection (SSN, credit card with Luhn validation, phone, email, bank accounts, state-specific driver's licenses) plus per-state statutory keyword matching. Optional LLM secondary review. All flags require human confirmation
- **Request Management** — Full lifecycle tracking with 10 statuses: received, clarification needed, assigned, searching, in review, ready for release, drafted, approved, fulfilled, closed. Timeline, messaging, fee tracking, and response letter generation
- **Guided Onboarding** — Two modes operators can switch between: a 3-phase form wizard (City Profile → Systems → Gap Map), and a single-phase LLM-powered adaptive interview that persists each answer (including `has_dedicated_it`) to the CityProfile singleton and drives the `onboarding_status` lifecycle (not_started → in_progress → complete). Skip advances the walk truthfully. Both modes surface coverage gaps across 12 municipal domains.
- **Municipal Systems Catalog** — Curated knowledge base of 25+ municipal software vendors across 12 functional domains (finance, public safety, permitting, HR, etc.) with discovery hints and connector templates
- **Universal Connector Framework** — Standardized protocol (authenticate/discover/fetch/health_check) for connecting to city data sources. Ships with four implemented connector types: `file_system` (local/mounted directories), `manual_drop` (watched drop folders), `rest_api` (generic REST API — API key / Bearer / OAuth2 client-credentials / Basic auth; JSON/XML/CSV; page/offset/cursor pagination), and `odbc` (SQL databases via pyodbc, row-as-document with SQL-injection guards). IMAP email, SMB/NFS, and SharePoint connectors on roadmap
- **Scheduled Sync & Idempotent Ingestion** — Per-source cron scheduling (5-field expressions via croniter, evaluated in UTC with local-time disclosure, rolling 7-day min-interval validation, 5-minute floor) with `schedule_enabled` pause toggle. Idempotent pipeline: binary sources dedup by content hash, structured REST/ODBC sources dedup by stable source-path with canonical JSON serialization. Concurrent-update races prevented via `SELECT FOR UPDATE` + partial UNIQUE indexes; content updates atomically replace chunks and embeddings in the same transaction
- **Sync Failure Tracking & Circuit Breaker** — Per-record failure tracking with two-layer retry (task-level exponential backoff + record-level per-tick retry with N=100/T=90s cap). Automatic circuit breaker after 5 consecutive full-run failures (`sync_paused`) with admin-feedback unpause grace period. `health_status` (healthy/degraded/circuit_open) computed live from failure counts. Admin UI: colored health badge, failed records panel with bulk retry/dismiss, Sync Now button with real-time polling progress
- **Operational Analytics** — Real-time metrics: average response time, deadline compliance rate, overdue requests, status breakdown
- **Notification Service** — Template-based notification system with SMTP email delivery via Celery beat (60s interval). Configure SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD in .env to enable. Notification dispatch into status transitions pending
- **Compliance by Design** — Hash-chained audit logs, human-in-the-loop enforcement, AI content labeling, data sovereignty verification. Designed for Colorado CAIA and 50-state regulatory compliance. CJIS compliance gate for public safety connectors
- **Civic Design System** — Professional UI built with shadcn/ui and civic blue design tokens. Responsive shell: fixed 240px sidebar at ≥768px, hamburger-driven slide-in drawer below that (with focus trap, ESC close, overlay dim, auto-close on route change). WCAG 2.2 AA targeted (44px touch targets, skip-to-content link, icon+color status badges, programmatic label→input associations on admin forms, `role="alert"` validation errors with actionable copy — full third-party accessibility audit still pending)
- **Federation-Ready** — REST API with service accounts enables future cross-jurisdiction record discovery between CivicSunshine instances

## Quick Start

### Requirements

CivicSuite is a **server product** — one server per city. Clerks reach the server through any modern browser; there is no clerk-side installation.

#### CivicSuite Server (one per city)

Runs the full Docker Compose stack: postgres, redis, ollama, api, celery worker, celery beat, and frontend.

- **CPU:** 8+ cores recommended.
- **RAM:** the installer gates on `MIN_RAM_GB` from `scripts/detect_hardware.sh` (32 GB at the time of writing). That value is flagged "needs measurement — arbitrary value pending peak-RAM profile" in its provenance comment; see the comment block at the top of `scripts/detect_hardware.sh` for the rationale and the intended revision path.
- **Disk:** 50 GB free.
- **Host OS:** Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) via `install.sh`, Windows 10/11 via `install.ps1`, or macOS via `install.sh` (script path; not lifecycle-certified). Docker Desktop / Docker Engine must already be installed and running.
- **Network:** No outbound internet connection required after initial setup.
- **Hardware cost (secondary market):** Refurbished Dell OptiPlex small-form-factor units with 16–32 GB RAM are commonly available and are a plausible hardware-cost target for a city-scale deployment. Confirm against `MIN_RAM_GB` (currently 32 GB) before purchasing on the low end of that range.

#### Clerk Workstation (one per clerk)

Any computer with a modern web browser. Clerks open the server's URL — **`http://<server>:8080`** — sign in, and use the application. **Zero client-side install** is required: no Docker, no helper script, no Python runtime, no model weights downloaded to the clerk machine. The server hosts everything.

- **Browser:** Chromium-based (Chrome, Edge), Firefox, or Safari — current version.
- **OS:** any (Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS — anything that runs a modern browser).
- **Network:** LAN access to the server on ports 8080 (web UI) and 8000 (API).
- **Install:** none.

### Install

> **Install paths.** Two options ship today:
>
> 1. **Windows double-click installer (T5E, UNSIGNED).** A signed build is a future release — this one is not. The unsigned installer is published on every release tag at `releases/download/<tag>/CivicSunshine-<version>-Setup.exe` along with a SHA-256 checksum for independent verification. On first run Windows SmartScreen shows **"Windows protected your PC — Unknown publisher."** This is expected. Click **More info → Run anyway** to proceed. See [installer/windows/README.md](installer/windows/README.md) for the full SmartScreen walkthrough and checksum-verify steps. The installer bundles the repo snapshot, runs a prereq check (Docker Desktop, WSL 2 + Virtual Machine Platform, 32 GB RAM floor, optional host Ollama), then runs `install.ps1` (via `installer\windows\launch-install.ps1`). `install.ps1` **auto-pulls `nomic-embed-text` and auto-pulls the Gemma 4 tag you select in the picker** (default `gemma4:e4b`) — expect several minutes on first run — and seeds the T5B baseline datasets.
>
> 2. **Script-based install (Linux / macOS — not lifecycle-certified — and Windows if you prefer CLI).** Windows-only currently; macOS support pending lifecycle certification. The scripts below configure and start the Docker Compose stack on macOS and Linux as a non-certified path, and on Windows as a CLI alternative. They do **not** install Docker, WSL, or any other system prerequisites — those must already be present. `install.ps1` / `install.sh` both ship the 4-model Gemma 4 picker, auto-pull the selected LLM plus `nomic-embed-text`, and auto-seed the baseline datasets on first boot.
>
> **Two shortcuts, two flows.** The Windows installer creates **separate** Start Menu entries for the two operations — don't confuse them:
>
> - **Start CivicSunshine** → daily start. Runs `docker compose up -d` and opens `http://localhost:8080/`. Does **not** run the prereq check, does **not** invoke `install.ps1`, does **not** pull any model, does **not** re-seed data. The Desktop shortcut (if you opted in) mirrors this daily-start behavior.
> - **Install or Repair CivicSunshine** → full bootstrap/repair. Runs the prereq check, then `install.ps1` (which may show the picker and pull models). Use this for first-run setup (the installer fires it automatically for you the first time), when you want to switch LLMs, or to repair a broken stack.
>
> **Docker Desktop and WSL 2** must be installed and running before either path; the installer detects their absence and prints concrete remediation, but does not install them for you.

For the CivicSuite starter-set package, run `python scripts/check_starter_set_integration.py --umbrella-root ..\civicsuite --require-archives` from this repo to verify that CivicCore installs first, CivicSunshine and CivicClerk are selectable, package workflow proof is required, and Linux/Windows starter-set archives exist.

**Windows:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/townlight/sunshine.git
cd civicrecords-ai
.\install.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux** (script path; not lifecycle-certified — see "Supported Platforms" below)**:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/townlight/sunshine.git
cd civicrecords-ai
bash install.sh
```

### First Use

1. Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser
2. Sign in with the admin credentials you configured in `.env`
3. Go to **Sources** → **Add Source** → enter a directory path to your documents
4. Click **Ingest Now** — documents are parsed, chunked, and indexed automatically
5. Go to **Search** — type a natural language query and get cited results

### Phase 1 migration layer

CivicSunshine backend installs `civiccore` (the shared CivicSuite schema + migration runtime) as a dependency. The current release line is pinned to the published CivicCore v1.2.0 wheel so Records-AI consumes the shared document-ingestion pipeline from a release artifact. Records-specific Celery tasks, scheduler wiring, connector sync, and datasource routes remain local; parsing, chunking, local Ollama embeddings, and pgvector document/chunk writes come from `civiccore.ingest`. Earlier interim branches used a commit archive while CivicCore v1.2.0 was unreleased; v1.7.2 returned to the versioned release-asset dependency pattern, and v1.7.3 adds direct-pip wheel and sdist assets without changing runtime behavior.

Migrations run in two layers: `civiccore` first (creates/updates the 16 shared tables), then this repo's Alembic chain on top. See [ADR-0003](https://github.com/townlight/townlight/blob/main/docs/architecture/ADR-0003-civiccore-alembic-baseline-strategy.md) for the full gate contract.

### Release provenance

CivicSunshine now wires release preflight to CivicCore's canonical
`civiccore.release_provenance` helper. This matters because GitHub release pages
can show the target commit as "Verified" even when the release tag is
lightweight or unsigned. Treat that badge as a commit signal only; the actual
trust artifact for post-baseline releases is the Sigstore-signed
`release-attestation.json` plus bundle documented in
[docs/ops/release-signing.md](docs/ops/release-signing.md).

The older public `v1.4.10` release is a historical pre-gate, provisional artifact because
its tag predates the attestation model and its public release assets do not
include `release-attestation.json` or `release-attestation.json.bundle`. CO-4
records the decision in
[docs/ops/tier1-retrofit-ledger.md](docs/ops/tier1-retrofit-ledger.md): do not
republish, mirror, or promote `v1.4.10` as an attested provenance baseline.

## Architecture

### Deployment stack

![Deployment stack — entire system runs inside Docker Compose on the city's network. No cloud, no outbound by default.](docs/diagrams/deployment-stack.svg)

### LLM call flow

![LLM call flow: records-ai application code routes through civiccore.llm (context assembly, template resolution, model registry, provider factory) to a local Ollama provider, with optional cloud providers.](docs/diagrams/llm-flow.svg)

### Sovereignty / data boundary

![Sovereignty boundary: all runtime components (FastAPI, Celery, Postgres+pgvector, Ollama, local volumes) live inside the city's on-prem network. No outbound by default; cloud is opt-in only.](docs/diagrams/sovereignty.svg)

**7 Docker services:** PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector, Redis 7.2, Ollama, FastAPI, Celery worker, Celery beat, nginx frontend.

**Tech stack:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, React 18, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Alembic, Celery, pgvector, nomic-embed-text, Gemma 4 (recommended).

## Configuration

Most configuration is via environment variables in `.env`. Secret material for
JWT signing and the initial admin password is file-backed in v1.6.0 and is not
placed in the container environment:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql+asyncpg://civicrecords:civicrecords@postgres:5432/civicrecords` |
| `FIRST_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Initial admin account email | `admin@example.gov` |
| `CIVICRECORDS_SECRET_DIR` | Host directory containing file-backed secrets for Docker Compose | `./data/secrets` |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Ollama API endpoint | `http://ollama:11434` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string | `redis://redis:6379/0` |
| `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` | Audit log retention period | `1095` (3 years) |
| `CONNECTOR_HOST_ALLOWLIST` | Comma-separated hostnames/IPs exempt from SSRF block (on-prem use) | (empty — RFC1918, loopback, and cloud IMDS ranges blocked by default) |

### Operations / Secrets

As of v1.6.0, `JWT_SECRET` and `FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are no longer runtime
container environment variables. The install scripts generate the same strong
random values as earlier releases, write them to `./data/secrets/jwt_secret`
and `./data/secrets/first_admin_password`, and configure Docker Compose to mount
those files at `/run/secrets/...`. The container environment intentionally does
not include `JWT_SECRET`, `FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, or matching `_FILE` pointer
names. A release rehearsal must prove:

```bash
docker exec <records-api-container> env | grep -E "JWT_SECRET|FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
```

returns zero lines.

**Upgrade note from v1.5.x:** existing installs that still have
`JWT_SECRET=...` or `FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD=...` in `.env` must re-run
`install.sh` or `install.ps1` so the secret files are created and `.env` keeps
only non-secret operator settings such as `CIVICRECORDS_SECRET_DIR`. Do not set
`JWT_SECRET*`, `FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`, or matching `_FILE` pointer env vars in
Docker deployments; those names are recoverable with `docker exec env`.

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 10/11 (Docker Desktop)
- macOS 13+ (Docker Desktop) — Windows-only currently; macOS support pending lifecycle certification (script-path install only)
- Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+ (Docker Engine)

All platforms use identical Docker containers — the application runs in Linux containers regardless of host OS.

## Data Sovereignty

CivicSunshine is designed for environments where resident data must never leave the network:

- Runs entirely on local hardware — no cloud dependencies
- No telemetry, analytics, or crash reporting
- All LLM inference runs locally via Ollama
- Live verification script confirms the running Compose stack is local-only: start the stack with `docker compose up -d`, then run `bash scripts/verify-sovereignty.sh`

### Testing Prerequisites

Integration tests require Docker Compose with PostgreSQL running, and the `civicrecords` Postgres user needs DROP/CREATE DATABASE privileges (the default docker compose config does this automatically). Each test drops and recreates `civicrecords_test` to guarantee a clean schema.

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
docker compose run --rm api python -m pytest tests -q
```

If a prior test run died mid-fixture, `civicrecords_test` may already exist and the suite will fail with `DuplicateDatabaseError`. Drop it manually and re-run:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres dropdb -U civicrecords civicrecords_test
```

## User Roles

| Role | Permissions | Phase |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Admin** | Full access: user management, system config, rule management, audit logs, onboarding | Built |
| **Staff** | Search, create requests, attach documents, scan for exemptions, review flags, manage fees | Built |
| **Reviewer** | Everything Staff can do + approve/reject responses and exemption flags | Built |
| **Read-Only** | View search results and request status only | Built |
| **Liaison** | Department-scoped read access to requests and search; Users/Audit Log/Onboarding nav hidden | Built |
| **Public** | Submit requests (T5D, authenticated only); track own requests [planned]; search published records [planned] | T5D `a57a897` (v1.2.0) |

Service accounts with hashed API keys enable instance-to-instance federation access.

## Status

**v1.7.3 (May 24, 2026)** — Release-asset convention bring-up. Adds wheel and sdist as published assets so direct-pip consumers can install from release URLs. No functional change. City-core installer continues to vendor source as before.

**v1.7.2 (May 23, 2026)** — CivicCore v1.2.0 shared-ingestion release-asset alignment. Records-AI now consumes the published CivicCore v1.2.0 wheel for parsing, chunking, local Ollama embeddings, and pgvector document/chunk writes instead of the temporary commit archive used before the CivicCore release artifact existed.

**v1.5.0 (May 10, 2026)** — CivicCore recovery alignment release. Records-AI now consumes civiccore v1.0.1, matching the active CivicSuite platform baseline and closing ENG-002. The imported CivicCore symbols remained compatible, so this release changes the dependency baseline and release evidence without changing API URL paths, roles, permissions, or records-side database migrations.

**v1.6.0 (May 11, 2026)** — Docker secret-file extraction release. `JWT_SECRET` and `FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` move out of container env vars and into Docker-mounted secret files. Existing v1.5.x installs must re-run `install.sh` or `install.ps1` so `./data/secrets/*` is created and `.env` keeps only non-secret operator settings; `_FILE` pointer env names are intentionally absent from the container env.

**v1.4.10 (May 3, 2026)** — Documentation-only release alignment patch. The v1.4.9 CivicCore source-status projection code is unchanged; this tag publishes the audit-corrected 631-backend-test evidence in the release source snapshot and installer/download docs.

**v1.4.9 (May 3, 2026)** — CivicCore source-status projection consumer patch. Records-AI now consumes civiccore v0.22.0 for datasource list health, active-failure count, pause, and next-run projection, preserving the existing `/datasources/` response shape while moving reusable operator-state semantics into CivicCore. API URL paths, roles, permissions, and records-side database migrations are unchanged from v1.4.8.

**v1.4.8 (May 2, 2026)** — CivicCore schedule validation consumer patch. Records-AI now consumes civiccore v0.21.0 for cron schedule validation and next-run computation, preserving the local `app.ingestion.cron_utils` import surface as a compatibility wrapper. API URL paths, roles, permissions, and records-side database migrations are unchanged from v1.4.7.

**v1.4.7 (May 2, 2026)** — CivicCore startup config validation consumer patch. Records-AI now consumes civiccore v0.20.0 for JWT secret, Fernet encryption key, first-admin password, and CSV allowlist parsing validation, on top of the v1.4.6 vendor-delta/mock-city extraction. API URL paths, roles, permissions, and records-side database migrations are unchanged from v1.4.6.

**v1.4.6 (May 2, 2026)** — CivicCore mock-city/delta consumer patch. Records-AI consumes civiccore v0.19.0 for vendor-delta request planning and reusable mock-city contract suites, on top of the v1.4.5 live connector retry and circuit-breaker extraction. API URL paths, roles, permissions, and records-side database migrations are unchanged from v1.4.5.

**v1.4.5 (May 2, 2026)** — CivicCore sync-consumer patch. Records-AI consumes civiccore v0.18.1 for live connector retry and circuit-breaker primitives, preserving the existing Records retry semantics and database-backed sync failure workflow while removing reusable local sync-state logic. API URL paths, roles, permissions, and records-side database migrations are unchanged from v1.4.4.

**v1.4.4 (May 1, 2026)** — CivicCore audit-consumer patch. Records-AI now consumes civiccore v0.17.0 for persisted audit-log hashing and verification, in addition to shared search, onboarding, connector-security, and ingest contracts. API URL paths, roles, permissions, and records-side database migrations are unchanged from v1.4.3.

**v1.4.3 (April 29, 2026)** — Shared connector-security extraction patch. Records-AI now consumes civiccore v0.13.0 for connector host validation and encrypted-config primitives instead of carrying private copies of those helpers. API URL paths, roles, permissions, and records-side database migrations are unchanged from v1.4.1.

**v1.4.0 (April 25, 2026)** — Phase 2 LLM integration. civiccore advanced from v0.1.0 to v0.2.0; LLM provider abstraction, prompt-template engine + 3-step override resolver, and model registry now sourced from `civiccore.llm`. Migration `020_phase2_consumer_app_backfill` runs after upgrade. Records-AI now consumes civiccore v0.2.0 as a versioned dependency.

**v1.3.0** — 2026-04-25 release. Phase 1 CivicCore extraction landed: `civiccore` v0.1.0 is now consumed as a release-wheel dependency. Two-layer migration order — civiccore migrations run first via subprocess, then records-side. No API or UI changes (infrastructure only). See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and the v1.3.0 release notes for operator upgrade guidance.

**v1.2.0** — 2026-04-23 release. Tier 5 (installer + onboarding + seeding + model picker + portal mode) and Tier 6 (at-rest encryption, ENG-001 closed) ship together. CI green on `d556904` (run 24853147133). Backend 617/617 pytest, frontend 36/36 vitest, unsigned Windows installer produced on tag push.

**v1.1.0** — Phase 2 release with department access controls, 50-state exemption rules, and compliance templates.

**New in v1.1.0:**
- Department-level access controls — staff scoped to own department, admins see all
- Department CRUD API with audit logging
- 50-state + DC exemption rule coverage (175 jurisdiction-scoped rules across 51 jurisdictions, plus 5 universal PII rules available in the seed source — 180 total)
- 5 compliance template documents (AI Use Disclosure, Response Letter Disclosure, CAIA Impact Assessment, AI Governance Policy, Data Residency Attestation)
- Template render endpoint with city profile variable substitution
- Exemption auditability dashboard with acceptance/rejection rates and CSV/JSON export (time-period filtering not yet implemented)
- Model registry CRUD endpoints (spec 6.7 compliance metadata)

**Carried from v1.0.x:**
- 13 staff workbench pages + Login with shadcn/ui design system
- 29 database tables, ~30 API endpoints
- 631 backend + 36 frontend automated tests passing (CI-verified on PR #61, run 25272823105)
- Guided onboarding, systems catalog, connector framework
- Request timeline, messaging, fee tracking, response letter generation
- Operational analytics and notification service
- AMD GPU/NPU hardware auto-detection (ROCm on Linux, DirectML on Windows)
- Login rate limiting, audit log archival, admin-only user creation
- Tested on Windows 11 (Docker Desktop) and Ubuntu 22.04 (Docker Engine)

**In v1.2.0 — Tier 5 (all five slices shipped 2026-04-22 → 2026-04-23, tagged in this release):**

- **T5C — 4-model Gemma 4 installer picker, 2026-04-22 (`7721cf0`):** Picker now shows exactly four supported Gemma 4 tags: `gemma4:e2b`, `gemma4:e4b` (default), `gemma4:26b`, `gemma4:31b` — with per-model disk footprint, min/recommended RAM advisories, and a `supportable_against_target` boolean against the locked Windows 11 / 32 GB baseline. The fake tags `gemma4:12b` and `gemma4:27b` that contaminated `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `scripts/detect_hardware.*`, and `backend/app/config.py` have been purged repo-wide. Host RAM is re-verified empirically at install time regardless of picker selection.
- **T5A — Onboarding persistence, 2026-04-22 (`1782573`):** The single-phase LLM-powered adaptive interview now actually persists each answer onto the `CityProfile` singleton (creating the row on the first answer), normalizes yes/no → bool for `has_dedicated_it`, and transitions `onboarding_status` (not_started → in_progress → complete). Skip advances the walk truthfully (previously it dropped answers silently). Coverage: 4 new persistence tests + 2 skip-truth regression tests; migration `018_city_profile_state_nullable.py` relaxes a constraint the persistence path needed.
- **T5B — First-boot baseline seeding, 2026-04-22 (`61449c5`):** `app/main.lifespan` now auto-seeds three baseline datasets on first boot: **175 state-scoped exemption rules across 51 jurisdictions** (from `STATE_RULES_REGISTRY`), **5 compliance templates**, and **12 notification templates**. Idempotent via skip-if-exists — admin customizations survive re-seed. Every run emits a start line, per-dataset `created` / `skipped` counts, and a completion summary. Universal PII regex rules are present in the seed source (5 additional rules, 180 total) but are **not** seeded by first-boot because they lack a two-letter `state_code`; those remain deferred pending schema relaxation. See `backend/app/seed/first_boot.py` and `§8.7` of the spec.
- **T5D — Install-time portal switch (private vs. public), 2026-04-23 (`a57a897`):** New `PORTAL_MODE` environment variable (`private` | `public`, default `private`) locked at install time, changeable post-install by editing `.env` and restarting the stack. The installer (`install.ps1` / `install.sh`) prompts for the choice interactively; non-interactive installs can pre-set `CIVICRECORDS_PORTAL_MODE`. Case and whitespace are normalized by a `field_validator` on the config model. **Private mode (default)** is staff-only — the login screen is the only externally reachable page, `/auth/register` returns 404, and `UserRole.PUBLIC` is not assignable. **Public mode** exposes exactly three surfaces and nothing more: (1) a public landing page, (2) a resident-registration path, and (3) an authenticated records-request submission form for `UserRole.PUBLIC` users. Submission requires authentication — anonymous walk-up submission is intentionally out of scope. Staff roles (ADMIN, STAFF, REVIEWER, READ_ONLY, LIAISON) continue to use `/requests/` and receive 403 on the public submit endpoint. An unauthenticated `GET /config/portal-mode` endpoint (typed `PortalModeResponse { mode: Literal["public","private"] }`) is always mounted so the frontend can discover the active mode on boot and branch its routing. Fixed a pre-existing bug in `UserCreate` that forced self-registered users to `UserRole.STAFF`; self-registration now correctly forces `UserRole.PUBLIC` (and is still only reachable in public mode). Coverage: 15 pytest cases in `backend/tests/test_portal_mode.py` plus 12 vitest cases across `PublicLanding.test.tsx`, `PublicRegister.test.tsx`, and `PublicSubmit.test.tsx`. Explicitly **not** shipped in this slice and not implied by any copy: published-records search, a full resident dashboard, a track-my-request suite, or any other public-portal feature.
- **T5E — Windows unsigned double-click installer, 2026-04-22 (`1d5429d`; test-harness flake fix `e898319`):** Real Windows `.exe` installer built with Inno Setup 6.x, produced on every `v*` tag by `.github/workflows/release.yml` on `windows-latest` via `choco install innosetup -y` + `installer/windows/build-installer.sh`. **Unsigned by design per Scott-locked B3=α posture** — operators must expect SmartScreen "Windows protected your PC — Unknown publisher" on first run; install path documented in [installer/windows/README.md](installer/windows/README.md). Flow is split into two Start Menu shortcuts: **Start CivicRecords AI** (daily `docker compose up -d`) and **Install or Repair CivicRecords AI** (full bootstrap + picker + model pull). Version is tag-derived (no hardcoded version drift) via `/DMyAppVersion=` from `$CIVICRECORDS_VERSION`. Desktop shortcut mirrors daily-start. macOS and Linux remain on the script path (`install.sh`) — native installer parity on those platforms is explicit follow-on work, not scheduled.
- **T3D regen** (`bf3c9c3`) — Regenerated `docs/openapi.json` and `frontend/src/generated/api.ts` after the T5A schema change; CI's stale-check gate enforces this on every subsequent backend schema or route change.
- **CI hygiene** (`5dbeed7`) — Bumped `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-node@v4` for Node 24 runtime support ahead of the 2026-06-02 GitHub runner default flip.

**In v1.2.0 — security hardening carried from earlier sprints (all tagged in this release):**
- **T2A** — Role self-escalation via `PATCH /users/me` closed (`UserSelfUpdate` schema); all 24 department-scoped handlers enforce `require_department_scope`; 404/403 status-code info-leak unified via `require_department_or_404`; Pattern D list-endpoint fail-open fixed on 4 routes; parameterized enforcement test covers 25 routes
- **T2B** — `connection_config` redacted from `GET /datasources/` for all non-admin users (`DataSourceAdminRead` returned only on admin write endpoints). **ENG-001 runtime exposure: closed.**
- **Tier 6 / ENG-001 — At-rest encryption for `data_sources.connection_config`, 2026-04-23:** Connector credentials are now encrypted at rest using Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) via a transparent SQLAlchemy `EncryptedJSONB` TypeDecorator; envelope shape is `{"v": 1, "ct": "<fernet-token>"}`. A new required `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var (installer auto-generates on fresh installs) drives the encryption; a reversible Alembic migration (`019_encrypt_connection_config`) encrypts existing plaintext rows and decrypts on downgrade. Operator verification: `docker compose run --rm --no-deps api python scripts/verify_at_rest.py`. **ENG-001 now fully closed.** Key rotation is not supported in this release and is tracked as a future slice; the versioned envelope (`"v": 1`) leaves the door open.
- **T2C** — `FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` startup validator (rejects `.env.example` placeholder, empty, <12 chars, and common defaults); SSRF host validator blocks loopback, IMDS, and RFC1918 ranges on REST and ODBC connector URLs at schema-validation time
- **T3A** — Create-user form now POSTs to `/api/admin/users` (was `/api/auth/register`, which silently downgraded submitted roles to STAFF)
- **CI** — 631 backend + 36 frontend tests (CI-verified on PR #61, run 25272823105); bootstrap-failure smoke test confirms stack rejects placeholder admin password; `docs/openapi.json` and `frontend/src/generated/api.ts` stale-check enforced on every build (T3D)

> **ENG-001 standing caveat (historical — closed 2026-04-23):** At-rest encryption for `data_sources.connection_config` landed as Tier 6 / ENG-001. Prior to Tier 6 the JSONB column was plaintext and visible to any database superuser, `pg_dump` output, or restored backup. Post-Tier-6 the column is stored as a Fernet envelope keyed off `ENCRYPTION_KEY`; `pg_dump` output and raw backups contain ciphertext only. T2B runtime exposure closed in an earlier sprint; Tier 6 closes the at-rest gap. ENG-001 is now fully closed. See Section 8.10 of [docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md](docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md) and the Operator section on the encryption key in [USER-MANUAL.md](USER-MANUAL.md) for details.

**Roadmap (per [canonical spec](docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md)):**

| Phase | Focus | Key Deliverables | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **Phase 0** | Design foundation | shadcn/ui, design tokens, sidebar shell, component library | In progress |
| **Phase 1** | Staff workbench redesign | Redesign all staff pages with new design system, WCAG 2.2 AA | In progress |
| **Phase 2** | New backend features | Fees, notifications (SMTP), response letters, context manager, analytics, liaison role, department scoping, audit retention | Partially built |
| **Phase 3** | Public portal | Public homepage, search, guided request wizard, request tracker, help pages | Partial — T5D minimal surface shipped (landing + resident-registration + authenticated submission); published-records search, resident dashboard, and track-my-request remain Planned |
| **Phase 4** | Transparency layer | Open records library, reporting dashboards, public archive, federation | Planned (v2.0) |

*Note: Version numbers (semver) track release history. Phase numbers track design completeness per the canonical spec. They are separate systems. Current build (v1.7.3) includes backend work from Phases 0-2, partial Phase 3, the CivicCore v1.2.0 shared-ingestion dependency update, and additive release assets for direct-pip consumers, but has not completed the full scope of any phase. See [canonical spec](docs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md) for complete requirements and [reconciliation](docs/RECONCILIATION-2026-04-13.md) for current gap analysis.*
