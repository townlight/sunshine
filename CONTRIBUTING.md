# Contributing to Townlight Records

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Townlight Records. This project helps American cities respond to open records requests using AI-powered document search — contributions that improve accuracy, coverage, or usability directly benefit municipal transparency.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (Windows, macOS) or **Docker Engine** (Linux)
- **Python 3.12+** (for running tests locally)
- **Node.js 22+** (for frontend development)
- **Git**

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/townlight/sunshine.git
cd civicrecords-ai

# Option A: Use the installer (recommended)
bash install.sh          # Linux/macOS
# .\install.ps1          # Windows PowerShell

# Option B: Manual setup
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p data/secrets
openssl rand -hex 32 > data/secrets/jwt_secret
openssl rand -hex 16 > data/secrets/first_admin_password
chmod 0400 data/secrets/jwt_secret data/secrets/first_admin_password
# Edit .env only for non-secret settings; JWT/admin password are file-backed.
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull nomic-embed-text
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

### GPU Acceleration

The installer auto-detects AMD GPUs and NPUs. You can also configure manually:

- **Linux (ROCm):** `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d`
- **Windows (DirectML):** Install [Ollama for Windows](https://ollama.com/download), then `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.host-ollama.yml up -d`

Hardware detection scripts: `scripts/detect_hardware.sh` (Linux) and `scripts/detect_hardware.ps1` (Windows).

### Running Tests

Tests run inside the API container (pytest and psycopg2 are included in the image):

```bash
# Copy tests into the running container and run
docker cp backend/tests/. "$(docker compose ps -q api)":/app/tests/
docker compose exec -T api sh -c "TESTING=1 python -m pytest tests/ -v"
```

Or run locally against a test database:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Start PostgreSQL and create test database
docker compose up -d postgres redis
docker compose exec postgres createdb -U civicrecords civicrecords_test

# Run tests
TESTING=1 DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://civicrecords:civicrecords@localhost:5432/civicrecords \
  python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Note:** The `TESTING=1` env var skips JWT secret validation so tests can run with a dummy secret.

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev    # Starts Vite dev server with hot reload
npm run build  # Production build
npx tsc --noEmit  # Type check
```

### Continuous Integration

Every push to `master` and every pull request runs the workflow in
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). It runs the same
commands documented in AGENTS.md Hard Rule 1a, plus a cross-check that the
number of tests pytest collects equals the number that pass (catches silent
test loss from skips, xfails, or early exits). See
[`.github/workflows/README.md`](.github/workflows/README.md) for the full
rationale and how to reproduce a CI failure locally.

If your PR fails CI, the `backend-logs-*` artifact attached to the run
contains `collect.log`, `run.log`, and `compose.log` — usually enough to
reproduce without re-running locally.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Open a GitHub Issue with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your OS and Docker version

### Suggesting Features

Open a GitHub Discussion in the Ideas category. Describe:
- The problem you're trying to solve
- Your proposed solution
- Who benefits from it

### Submitting Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Make your changes following the coding standards below
4. Write or update tests for your changes
5. Run the full test suite and ensure it passes
6. Commit with conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
7. Push and open a Pull Request

### Coding Standards

**Python (Backend)**
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Type hints on all public functions
- Use async/await consistently
- Every API endpoint must be audit-logged
- Every endpoint must use `require_role()` for authorization

**TypeScript (Frontend)**
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types except in catch blocks
- Use react-router `Link` for navigation (not `<a href>`)
- Every page needs loading, error, and empty states
- Add `aria-label` to interactive elements and tables

**Tests**
- Unit tests for pure logic (parsers, chunking, rules engine)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external services (Ollama) in tests
- Use existing fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`

**Commits**
- One logical change per commit
- Conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`
- Run tests before committing
