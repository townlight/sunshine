# CivicSunshine -- Daily start flow (T5E).
#
# This script brings up the existing Docker Compose stack and opens the
# admin panel. It does NOT run the prereq check, does NOT invoke
# install.ps1, does NOT re-pull any model, and does NOT re-seed data.
#
# Invoked from:
#   - Start Menu shortcut "Start CivicSunshine"
#   - Desktop shortcut "Start CivicSunshine" (if the desktopicon task
#     was selected at install time)
#
# For first-run install, LLM changes, or repair, use the separate
# "Install or Repair CivicSunshine" shortcut (launch-install.ps1).
#
# Called with:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -File launch-start.ps1
#
# The working directory at entry is {app}. Everything below is relative.
