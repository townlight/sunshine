# CivicSunshine — Install / Repair flow (T5E).
#
# This script runs the full first-run bootstrap or an on-demand repair.
# Invoked from:
#   - Inno Setup's [Run] section immediately after Setup completes (first run)
#   - Start Menu shortcut "Install or Repair CivicSunshine" (manual repair)
#
# It is NOT the daily-start flow. The daily-start flow is launch-start.ps1,
# wired to the Start Menu / Desktop shortcut "Start CivicSunshine".
#
# Steps:
#   1. Run prereq-check.ps1. Exit if a required prereq is missing.
#   2. Invoke install.ps1 (ships the T5C 4-model Gemma 4 picker and the
#      T5B first-boot auto-seed).
#      install.ps1 will:
#        * run "docker compose pull" and "docker compose up -d"
#        * pull the "nomic-embed-text" embedding model via Ollama
#        * pull the Gemma 4 model the operator selects in the picker
#          (default: gemma4:e4b). Expect several minutes on first run.
#        * auto-seed the T5B baseline datasets on backend first boot
#   3. On successful install, open the admin panel in the default browser.
#
# Called with:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -File launch-install.ps1
#
# The working directory at entry is {app} (set by the Inno Setup [Icons]
# entry's `WorkingDir` attribute). Everything below is relative to that.
